# Are-individuals-with-higher-BMI-more-prone-to-Type-2-diabetes-compared-to-those-with-normal-BMI-
This study design aims to determine whether individuals with high BMI are more prone to T2DM through statistical analysis of a diverse population.
## Study Design
This observational study involves no external manipulation and will recruit participants aged 18–35 years without Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes or severe comorbidities (e.g., liver, kidney, or cancer-related conditions). Participants will be prescreened to ensure a balanced sample based on demographics and lifestyle. Fasting glucose levels will be monitored using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices over 10 days and standardized fasting blood glucose (FBG) tests after an 8-hour overnight fast, with blood samples collected at a testing center. The study includes participants with a normal BMI (22.6 ± 1.7 kg/m²) and pre-meal glucose levels of 79.4 ± 8.0 mg/dL, as well as overweight participants (BMI 27.3 ± 4.7 kg/m²) with fasting glucose levels of 84.6 ± 7.2 mg/dL. Participants will consume both standardized and self-selected meals during the study.
## Null and Alternative Hypotheses: 
Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean for fasting glucose level of Normal BMI individuals is the same as for higher BMI individuals (μ1 = μ2).
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):  The mean for fasting glucose level of Normal BMI individuals is different from that for higher BMI individuals (μ1 ≠ μ2), indicating a higher risk of Type-2 diabetes.
